# Joy – AI Tutor After the Bootcamp

Live Demo: https://learn-ai-tutor.streamlit.app/

A Streamlit-powered learning assistant with vector search, YouTube/PDF ingestion, and AI reasoning.

Joy is an intelligent AI tutor built to help developers continue learning after finishing their coding bootcamp.
Bootcamps move fast. Once they’re done, many learners feel stuck. Joy solves this by letting you:

Upload your PDF notes,

Ingest and understand YouTube lectures,

Ask deep AI/ML/technical questions,

Search your personalized knowledge base using vectors,

Chat naturally through a clean Streamlit UI.

Joy becomes your ongoing mentor—patient, clear, and always available.

### 🔍 Component Breakdown

#### **Streamlit UI**
The user-facing interface where learners interact with Joy.

#### **LangChain Agent**
Handles reasoning, tool-calling, and response generation.

#### **Ingestion Tools**
- **YouTube ingestion** → yt_dlp → Whisper ASR → chunking → embeddings  
- **PDF ingestion** → PyMuPDF → OCR → chunking → embeddings  

#### **Pinecone Vector Database**
Stores all embedded knowledge for retrieval.

#### **Embeddings**
Generated via **SentenceTransformer — all-MiniLM-L6-v2**.

#### **LangSmith Evaluation**
Used for:
- Tracing  
- Debugging  
- Monitoring accuracy  
- Improving agent behavior
